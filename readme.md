# Arithmetic Unit Circuit
An arithmetic unit circuit capable of adding, subtracting and multiplying two signed magnitude numbers, implemented using Logisim.


## Overview 
This circuit allows user to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. The circuit takes two 5-bits signed magnitude inputs, "A" and "B" and perform the choosen operation on them, showing the output on a seven segment dispaly. This was the project of the first course in Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department.


## How to Use
1. Download "Logisim".
2. Open "PROJECT.circ" file with "Logisim".\

3. Enter the first number "A" in binary form, also for the second number "B" by using the the switches.
4. From numeric input "Mode", choose the operation to be executed on the two number "A" and "B".
- 00 for addition
- 01 for subtraction
- 10 for multiplication
- 11 for division 
5. Output will be shown on the seven segment display, and the flags if needed.
